# Instructions:

Press draw to play. 

You will see that each players cards will contain a variable, suit, and value of that variable. Whichever player has the highest value card will receive two cards in their discard pile representing them receiving both cards played. Once all 26 rounds are over, whichever player has the most cards in their discard pile is declared the winner. You will then be prompted to press the rematch button to reset the game and play again!

# Next Steps:

-Would like to make it so the cards have the number in the top left corner, the suit in the center, and the value in the bottom right corner like a regular card
-Possibly create point system that keeps track of wins
-Create where you can play against the computer
