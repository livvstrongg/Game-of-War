# Game-of-War

# Overview of the Game:

Player 1 and Player 2 are battling for the title of winner. The 'war' is comprised of several 'battles' in which each player draws a card and places it upright in the center of the table. Whichever players card has a higher value wins that battle and gets to place both cards played back into their deck. The first player to lose all of their cards is the loser and the other player is declared winner. 

# Details:

The game is played with a basic deck of 52 cards. Cards include four suits: Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, and Spades. Within each suit is a 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,Jack,Queen, King, and an Ace card. A 2 is considered least value, while an Ace is considered highest value. For example if Player 1 plays a Jack and Player 2 plays a 7, Player 1 would win that round. 

# In the event of a tie:

Say both players play a card of the same value (i.e. 4 of Hearts & 4 of Clubs). In this event both players would have to lay, face down, 3 cards and flip the fourth card over. Whoever has the highest fourth card wins the battle and gets to keep the total amount of cards that have been played on the table.
